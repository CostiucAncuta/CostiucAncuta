### Hello there 👋🏻

>I'm **Ancuta** – Aspiring Web Developer and Former Fashion wizard 👩‍💻 👗🪄


> A creative soul transitioning from the world of high fashion to web development.<br>
> After years of transforming designer sketches into runway-ready garments, I’ve embarked on a new adventure in tech, blending my artistic vision with code.<br>
> After I finished the [Becode-Gent](https://becode.org/) bootcamp, where I’ve build the foundation for mastering front-end and back-end technologies, I've enroled in an internship at 3D Software Lab and honestly? I’m loving every moment of this exciting journey! 😊<br>
